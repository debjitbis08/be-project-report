\chapter{Future Plans}

Unfortunately there are no formally proven bounds for the maximum and minimum service
errors known. Further, while multi-processor capability could be added to VTRR, it is only
specified for uni-processor systems, rendering it an ill choice for most modern operating
systems. Therefore VTRR can be considered a step into the right direction, but it is far
from an optimal solution.

Also how the algorithm behaves in the microkernel environment of MINIX is yet to seen. The
algorithms performance has to be studied with this in mind.

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing other fair schedulers such as $GR^3$
\item Implementing VTRR using the modular scheduler framework.
\item Measuring the performance of VTRR in microkernel architecture context.
\end{itemize}
